In this project, I built a model to predict the secondary structure of proteinsâ€”whether each residue is a Helix (H), Extended Sheet (E), or Coil (C). I used a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) in PyTorch, trained on protein sequences and PSSM profiles from the PDB database. The input data includes amino acid sequences and evolutionary profiles (PSSM), and the output is the predicted secondary structure for each residue.
